              Vancouver Woodworks began business in 1991 and primarily built
              furniture for other retailers on the West Coast. We supplemented
              our factory in 1995 with the opening of our own on-site showroom.
              At that time, we also began bringing furniture in from other
              manufacturers to help round out the assortments. This showroom was
              a good start, but was difficult to get to, and even harder to find
              so we moved our store downtown to Broadway and 10th in 1999.

              While at this location, we opened The Naked Furniture Company on
              Andresen Rd. This store specialized in unfinished furniture and
              finishing supplies – a niche that needed filling in Clark County.

              In 2002, in need of a larger location, we moved from Broadway to
              our current building on Andresen Road. We added framed art,
              clocks, lamps and accessories to our selection.

              Summer of 2005 saw our most recent change. We consolidated both of
              our stores into one location at 3000 NE Andresen Rd. This move
              allowed us to expand our furniture lines to include many American
              Made products. We are now centrally located with ample parking.
